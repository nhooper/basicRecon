Script for automating basic network attacks

Open terminal
cd /root/Desktop/
mkdir Scripts
cd Scripts
Place the script in here
chmod +x ClassCopy
./ClassCopy

ESSID can be left blank for most attacks

The original window will stay open and remember inputs until told to normalize.

File was copied from my Linux distro. If for whatever reason it fails to execute here is the source code so that you may make the script yourself
Inside the Scripts folder do:

Copy the source code
vi MyClassCopy
Press I to get the insertion point
Press ctrl + shift + v to paste into the terminal
press : + w to write 
press : + q to quit
chmod +x MyClassCopy
or use your own GUI text editor
